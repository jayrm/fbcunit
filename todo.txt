fbcunit TODO list:

[ ] in the QB version, SUITE_INIT and SUITE_CLEANUP
	need to set the function return value.  Consider
	adsing a macro to set the value.

	Current	work around is:

	SUITE( somename )
		SUITE_INIT
			somename.init = true
		END_SUITE_INIT
		SUITE_CLEANUP
			somename.cleanup = true
		END_SUITE_CLEANUP
	END_SUITE

[X] group the tests by suite before running the list
	of tests.  Currently the sequence is by test then
	by suite creating NxM comparisons.

[X] create a hash look-up or similar for find_suite()
	find_suite is needed because possible that the
	same suite could be defined across multiple
	source modules.  currently is a trivial sequential
	scan and won't scale well.

[X] qb doesn't support namespaces and many other 
    keywords so need a wrapper api for the lang qb mode

[X] fix the of adding tests to the default suite
	see tests/fbcu_global.bas and then compare
	to the output when running tests/tests.exe
	The global suite index is not set correctly
	or is set at the wrong time -- a bug

[X] add SUITE_INIT and SUITE_CLEANUP macros to allow
	creating a proc for code that needs to run at
	beginning and end of a suite at run-time.

		SUITE( fbcu )
			SUITE_INIT
				'' start-up code
			END_SUITE_INIT
			SUITE_CLEANUP
				'' clean-up code
			END_SUITE_CLEANUP

			TEST( first )
			END_TEST

			... etc
		END_SUITE
